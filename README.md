Project Summary: The zooplankton prediction is linked to aquatic health and the proliferation of phytoplankton, which can then cause harmful algal blooms. The next day prediction can enable early warning. 

Description: Zooplankton are crucial to aquatic ecosystems. They are primary consumers, grazing on phytoplankton and acting as a vital link in the food web, transferring energy to higher trophic levels like fish. As such, their abundance and composition are considered good indicators of water quality and overall ecosystem health. Changes in zooplankton populations can indicate environmental disruptions, such as pollution or shifts in phytoplankton populations. Zooplankton consume phytoplankton. When phytoplankton populations experience rapid growth, often fueled by excess nutrients (a process called eutrophication), it can lead to an algal bloom. If these blooms are composed of species that produce toxins or cause other negative environmental impacts (like oxygen depletion), they are termed harmful algal blooms (HABs). Zooplankton grazing can impact the dynamics of these blooms, and in some cases, can even control them by consuming the harmful algae, according to ScienceDirect.com. Given the critical role of zooplankton in the aquatic food web and their sensitivity to environmental changes, monitoring and predicting zooplankton dynamics can indeed contribute to an early warning system for aquatic problems, including the potential for HABs. By observing trends in zooplankton populations and understanding their interactions with phytoplankton and other environmental factors, scientists can develop models to forecast the occurrence of HABs and their potential severity. This information can then be used to inform public health advisories and support management actions to mitigate the impacts of blooms. 

Planned Methodology: Use acoustic Environmental data to predict the abundance of zooplankton.
